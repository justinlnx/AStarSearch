SFU CMPT310 Assignment One: Implement the shortest path algorithm

This is a pretty typical problem, no? We have a starting point, and ending point, and a bunch of roads we can take to get there. We can even abstract this so that the roads are "moves" (of, say, a little sliding puzzle) and the points are states of the puzzle. Our goal is to find the shortest path possible to the end node in the fewest moves â€” and not take a long time to find it!

"Coloring" a node means marking it to show we've gone there. This prevents a search from searching the same node more than once. This algorithm works -- oh, it works. In fact, this method will always find you *a* path to the solution. Not that it's special or anything -- the next two methods will always find the solution as well, only they won't take until Hell freezes over to find it. Take, for example, the poor sod below. He looks happy, but that's simply because he's an idiot. Looking for treasure in this vast cavern, this guy decided to systematically use dfs. He will eventually find the gold for sure. He may traverse the entire graph, though, when he could have simply looked to his left! This kind of blind search, not taking into account the location of the goal, is likely to take much more time than an intelligent search. But before improving on our guessing skills, let's examine another algorithm.
